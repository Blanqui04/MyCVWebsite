# Ernest Ceballos Personal Website

## Project Overview

This project is a personal CV website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and personal information. It includes sections for biography, portfolio, skills, and a downloadable CV, as well as a radar chart displaying personal aptitudes. The website is responsive, includes smooth animations, and offers interactivity with a contact form. It was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js.

## Project Analysis

### 1. User Profile

The website is designed for potential employers, recruiters, or collaborators who are interested in my professional background and projects. The user is likely looking for a clean, easy-to-navigate site that highlights both my technical skills and personal aptitudes. Additionally, it is geared towards users who might want to contact me directly via email or review my portfolio through links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

**Persona:**
- **Name:** Laura Rodr√≠guez
- **Age:** 35
- **Occupation:** HR Manager at a Tech Firm
- **Goals:** Laura is reviewing candidates for a Data Scientist position and needs to quickly understand a candidate's technical abilities and professional experience.
- **Technology Use:** She is proficient in using web tools, and she appreciates websites that are well-organized and responsive across devices.

### 2. Information Architecture

The website is structured as a single-page layout, with navigation links that scroll to specific sections. These sections are designed in a logical order to guide the user through key areas of my profile:
1. **Biography:** A brief introduction to my background, education, and current role.
2. **Portfolio:** A list of relevant projects, including links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles for more details.
3. **Skills (Aptituds):** An unordered list of technical skills, programming languages, and tools I use.
4. **Graphics (Aptituds Personals):** A radar chart using Chart.js that visually represents my personal aptitudes like communication, dedication, teamwork, and creativity.
5. **Curriculum:** A summary of my experience and education, with a downloadable PDF link to my full CV.
6. **Contact:** Includes both personal and university email addresses, a simple contact form with validation, and links to social media profiles.

This architecture ensures the most important information is easily accessible and encourages interaction through the contact form and portfolio links.

### 3. Visual Design

The visual design uses a clean and modern aesthetic with a focus on green tones (#2e8b57) to align with my personal preference for the color. The layout is simple and readable, with responsive design elements that adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Typography:** I chose a sans-serif font (Arial) for a clean and modern look, ensuring high readability on different devices.
- **Color Palette:** The dominant color is a green shade (#2e8b57), which is used for headings, borders, and highlights. This color gives the site a professional but approachable feel. White (#FFFFFF) backgrounds are used for the sections to maintain a clean and bright look, and gray tones (#f0f0f0, #333) are used for text and background contrast.
- **Layout:** The page is centered with a maximum width of 900px for comfortable reading. Each section is visually separated with white backgrounds and box shadows to create a card-like effect. Transitions and animations (fade-in and scale on hover) are used to make the user experience smoother.
- **Responsiveness:** The website is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. Media queries adjust font sizes, margins, and layout to ensure readability and usability on smaller screens.

### 4. Figma Design

The design process was first outlined using Figma, where the layout, color scheme, and typography choices were visualized. You can view the Figma project [here](https://www.figma.com/design/3wCW1Ru5zZjLhyitEsw2q8/LaMevaPaginaPersonal?node-id=0-1&t=V0ieqN3l6X2GBC9Y-1).
